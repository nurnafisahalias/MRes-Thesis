Title,Chemically engineering diatoms and algae for novel battery material
Abstract,"Data produced for MRes eeChange research project. Algae and diatoms were cultured in chemically-enhanced media, phosphate for algae and aluminium/zinc for diatoms. Measurements from SEM-EDS were done to quantify the uptake of chemicals."
,"The result show that the higher the concention of phosphate added to the media where algae was cultured, the more % mol P found. However, the uptake of Al/Zn is highly specific on species."

Taxonomic description,"Green algae Chlamydomonas Pulvinata, and diatoms Thalassiosira Pseudonana and Thalassiosira Weissflogii were used in this project"
Methods,Green algae was cultured in freshwater of different concentrations of phosphates
,Diatoms were cultured in seawater of different concnetrations of aluminium or zinc
,"Green algae and diatoms undergo centrifugal treatment and were collected as pellets which were washed with 10% SDS, water and ethanol."
,The samples were then prepared on aluminium stubs with carbon stickers and left to be dried before being coated with gold.
,"SEM-EDS images were collected, point analysis was done on 5 points on each 5 cells"
Quality assurance,"Nafisah cultured, harvested, purified and prepared the samples for the analysis"
Data descriptors,"SEM_EDS_Data contains the % mol of Si, O, Al, Zn and P. input with 'nd' means not detected"
